# Retrain VGG 19 pretrained model on custom dataset
in this project we will load the pre-trained VGG 19 model and apply transfer learning with our dataset.
And after training the model, we will draw graphs that show the precision and the loss during the "learning" process.
and finally we must save our model in a file with the extension .h5, and the architecture of our model in a JSON file
So let's get started.
## Prepare the data
we must first divide our data into two parts "validation" and "train"
